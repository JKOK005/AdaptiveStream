Current implementation supports the following kinds of compaction policies(s):

| Rule | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
|DistillCompaction | Conducting compaction with knowledge distillation |
|EnsembleCompaction| Conducting compaction with model ensemble|
|EnsembleCompaction| Conducting compaction with meta-learning|
|AdaptationCompaction| Conducting compaction with adaptive weights|


More classes may be implemented in the future.
